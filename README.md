# Luxury Goods: Market Analysis
With data scraped in Python on a live connection to Tableau, I explored the effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Luxury Goods industry and CAC40 Index. This analysis included visualizations of stock market data, and a combination of qualitative and quantitative indicators. Various factors impacting the luxury goods market were discussed with context and insight.
